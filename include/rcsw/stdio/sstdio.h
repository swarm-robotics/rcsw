/**
 * @brief Print formatted strings to stdout.
 *
 * This routine supports standard format string/variable arg display of chars to
 * a terminal, but requires the use of va_args, instead of a variable number of
 * arguments ala printf(). It can be invoked directly, but is most commonly
 * invoked by \ref sstdio_printf().
 *
 * The following format modifiers are supported (All format modifiers must
 * appear before any format specifiers in the format block). As a general rule
 * mixing format modifiers should be done with care, because there are a lot of
 * combinations that I haven't tested...
 *
 * #  :     Add a 0x prefix. Only affects format blocks containing a x or X.
 *          Implies a fill character of 0; do not specify a fill char with #
 *          (i.e., #4x = add 0x prefix and zero-fill up to 4 printing digits,
 *          #04x is undefined.)
 *
 * pq :     Fill characters. Print q characters; if p is not present, numbers which
 *          ultimately render into < q digits will be space-filled. If p is 0,
 *          then numbers will be 0 filled. If the argument ultimately renders
 *          into > q digits, then the request to print only p of them is
 *          ignored. If fill characters are desired, then the pq format
 *          modifier must be specified as the last format modifier before the
 *          main format specifier (d,x,X are supported). If the argument is
 *          negative the sign character is included in the length of the
 *          rendered argument when determining the number of fill
 *          characters. The maximum number of fill chars is limited to 9.
 *
 * + :      Always include the sign specifier. Valid to be used with d,i format
 *          format specifiers. (Don't need to support x,X--hex numbers are
 *          ALWAYS display as positive numbers). If used in conjunction with
 *          character filling, the sign is include the sign character is
 *          included in the length of the rendered argument when determining
 *          the number of fill characters.
 *
 * -        Left-justify the result. Only really helpful with a width
 *          specifier, to pad on the right instead of the left. Only use with d.
 *
 * .pq :    Floating point precision. Display p characters after the decimal point
 *          if not enough characters exist, the result will be 0 padded. If the
 *          argument requires > p digits, then it is rounded appropriately to be
 *          displayed in p digits. Maximum of 8 digits. Valid to be used with f,
 *          e,E format specifiers.
 *
 * The following format specifiers are supported:
 * d       : Decimal signed integer (positive or negative)
 * x       : Hexadecimal, with a,b,c,d,e,f (positive only; neg numbers treated
 *                                          as size_t, i.e. -0x100 treated as
 *                                          0xffffff00)
 * X       : Hexadecimal, with A,B,C,D,E,F (positive only; neg numbers treated
 *                                          as size_t, i.e. -0x100 treated as
 *                                          0xffffff00)
 * c       : Character
 *
 * s       : String. Must be null-terminated.
 *
 * p       : Pointer. Note that the p and x format specifiers are NOT equivalent
 *           in general when rendering a pointer argument--they can be equivalent
 *           in some implementations. x casts the argument to an size_t integer,
 *           while p interpets it as is. On SPARC, p and x happen to behave the
 *           same; i.e., size_t int is 32 bits, and so is a pointer. On 64 bit
 *           x86, they are not equivalent. As a general rule use p for pointers
 *           and x/X for other size_t ints. Using this format specifier will
 *           automatically prepend 0x to the rendered argument.
 *
 * f       : Floating point. The argument is treated as a floating point number.
 *           If the argument is not a floating point number, then this doesn't
 *           work. If the number is really small or really large, then
 *           scientific notation will be used. If scientific notation is used a
 *           lowercase 'e' will be used for the exponent, and at least 2 digits
 *           will be used for the power. Unless the floating point decimal
 *           precision specifier is used, 6 digits will be displayed.
 *
 * e : Floating point, but force scientific notation, regardless of argument's
 * size. Uses 'e' as the exponent character.
 *
 * E : Same as 'e', but with an 'E' for an exponent.
 *
 * The following format specifiers are planned, but not yet implemented:
 * g       : use the shorter of f and e
 * G       : use the shorter of f and E
 * .qi     : Precision: minimum number of digits printed for integer. Zero fill.
 *
 * @param fmt The format string.
 * @param argp The list of arguments passed to printf().
 *
 * NOTES:
 * If the number you request to print is more digits than you requested to print
 * (i.e. you said %3d for a 5 digit integer) then your request will be ignored
 * and the full number of digits printed.
