   * If the parent node is black we are all set, if it is red we have
   * the following possible cases to deal with.  We iterate through
   * the rest of the tree to make sure none of the required properties
   * is violated.
   *
   *	1. The uncle is red.  We repaint both the parent and uncle black
   *     and repaint the grandparent node red.
   *
   *  2. The uncle is black and the new node is the right child of its
   *     parent, and the parent in turn is the left child of its parent.
   *     We do a left rotation to switch the roles of the parent and
   *     child, relying on further iterations to fixup the old parent.
   *
   *  3. The uncle is black and the new node is the left child of its
   *     parent, and the parent in turn is the left child of its parent.
   *     We switch the colors of the parent and grandparent and perform
   *     a right rotation around the grandparent.  This makes the former
   *     parent the parent of the new node and the former grandparent.
   *
   * Note that because we use a sentinel for the root node we never
   * need to worry about replacing the root.
